1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,295
In the beginning,
God created

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,339
the heavens and the earth.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,509
The earth was without
form and void,

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,512
and darkness was on
the face of the deep.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,391
And the Spirit of God
was hovering

6
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,518
over the face of the waters.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,480
Then God said...
'Let there be light.'

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,568
And there was light.

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,476
Thus the heavens
and the earth and

10
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,562
all the host of them
were finished.

11
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,399
And then, the Lord
God formed man

12
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,610
of the dust
of the ground...

13
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,781
and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life.

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,079
God created
man and woman in his likeness.

15
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,711
Then God looked upon
all He had done,

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,839
and saw that it was good.

Joy! Uh, hi!

28
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,014
Chris Quantum,
you're spying on your father?

29
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,143
No, I'm not 'spying.'
Exactly.

30
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:27,230
Look, dad's been working for
weeks on a 'top-secret' project.

31
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,607
Only, he won't even let
me into the lab!

32
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,234
What doesn't he want
me to see?

33
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,779
Oh! No! I've run out of
Amphigorium 2-3-3!

34
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,699
And I simply can't finish my
invention without it!

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,910
Anything I can do to help
while you're gone, dad?

36
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:45,081
Ahh, no! And Chris --
remember, do not go in the lab!

37
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,249
Is that clear?

38
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,917
Yes sir.

39
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,627
Good! Okay, gotta go!

40
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,343
Hey.
Dad left the door open!

41
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,971
We better make sure
everything's okay!

42
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,814
Whoa!!

43
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,944
What is it?

44
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,947
My scanners indicate it
is a personal jet-pack, only far

45
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,075
more compact and efficient than
any previous design.

46
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,123
It probably wouldn't hurt
if you just --

47
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,084
ya know -tried it on maybe.

48
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,256
Chris, do not do
it! You must obey your father.

49
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,802
Relax, Gizmo.
Nothing's gonna happen.

50
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,891
Hey!!

51
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,150
Whaaa... See? No problem!

52
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,818
Now I'll just put it back and

53
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,956
--Waaaaaaahh-ooohhh-
eeeee-looookout!

54
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,180
There's no way we can clean this
up before dad gets home!

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,349
'We' does not compute
Chris.

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,227
Ah, aren't 'you' the one
who disobeyed your father?

57
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,853
SUPERBOOK!!

58
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,315
Superbook, this is a very
bad time to ...

59
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,865
WHOAAA!

60
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,286
WHAAAA....!!!

61
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,040
I am taking
you to a place and time

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,002
when disobedience
destroyed the world.

63
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,179
Giz, where are we?

64
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,726
I-I cannot lock in on our
time OR location.

65
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,239
Do not be afraid.
No harm will come to you here.

66
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,076
My name is Michael and you
are in Heaven...

67
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:33,249
The perfect gift that God has
promised to all of His children.

68
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,465
Huhhh... Wooahw...

69
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,345
It's... amazing.

70
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,932
What is that
trumpet blast?

71
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,186
I... do not know!

72
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,294
I am God's
greatest work.

73
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:24,801
AND I SHALL ASCEND
ABOVE ALL OF CREATION!

74
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,307
ATTACK!

75
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,944
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

76
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,006
ONWARD!

77
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,977
HEAVEN IS MIIIIIIIINE!

78
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,443
LUCIFER!

79
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,073
Come, Michael. Serve me
and share in my triumph!

80
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,412
Or taste eternal defeat.

81
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,958
I do not fear you,
Lucifer -- for I serve the Lord.

82
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,420
Pity.....

83
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,345
I am too scared to look!

84
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,112
You have sinned against
the Lord --

85
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,990
and for that you shall be
banished!

86
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,985
Help me.

87
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,614
I have the power to reward you
beyond your dreams.

88
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,996
How you have fallen
from heaven,

89
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,373
O Lucifer, son of the morning!

90
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,512
How you are cut down
to the ground,

91
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:01,183
You who weakened the nations!
Yet, now you are brought down

92
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,186
to the lowest depths of the Pit.

93
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,025
Why did he do this?

94
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,696
He thought he
could be like God.

95
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,004
Where are we now?

96
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,175
Is this still heaven?

97
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,802
We call this Eden.

98
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,928
Whoa!

99
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,806
ADAM: I am Adam.

100
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,309
EVE: And I am called Eve.

101
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,271
GIZMO: Pissst...Why aren't they
wearing clothes?

102
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,649
JOY: I don't know.
Just deal with it.

103
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,239
GIZMO: Okay. I'm good.

104
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,744
ADAM: When I was naming the
animals God put here for us...

105
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,287
I must have missed you.

106
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,997
CHRIS: I'm Chris!
JOY: And I'm Joy!

107
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,123
GIZMO: And I'm --

108
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
ADAM: No, no, wait. I will come
up with something.

109
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,252
You're -- aaa...

110
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,465
GIZMO: I'll give you a hint.
I'm GIZMO.

111
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,051
EVE: GIZMO! That is perfect.

112
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,552
ADAM: 'Gizmo' it is!

113
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,929
GIZMO: Yes, it is.

114
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,643
JOY: Now what's your -- uh-oh.

115
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,949
Okay. We're lunch.

116
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,249
CHRIS: Uh, why didn't it eat us?

117
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,167
ADAM: Why would it?

118
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,837
JOY: 'Cuz that's what wild
animals do?

119
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,755
EVE: Not here in Eden.

120
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,133
ADAM: God has filled this place
with many wonders.

121
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,093
Come, let us show you.

122
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,863
ADAM: And from here, you can see
Eden's four great rivers.

123
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:23,159
GIZMO: Ah, yes. The Tigris, the
Euphrates, Pishon and Gihon.

124
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,119
ADAM: How did you know
their names?

125
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,620
GIZMO: Uh...
CHRIS: Uh, he...

126
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,955
GIZMO: ... Lucky guess?!

127
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:42,136
SATAN: Oh, You who created
the majesty of this universe,

128
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:47,016
Oh, how I shall ravage your
glorious work,

129
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,770
one simple perfection at a time.

130
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,360
Earth will be my new domain.

131
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:11,248
Ahhh! Mmm.
That's my fifth

132
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
Gizmo-liscios-blendtastic-fruit
smoothie!

133
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,669
Mmm,

134
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,339
How come food doesn't taste
this good back home?

135
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,132
GIZMO: No preservatives.

136
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,094
EVE: God has given us everything
here in the Garden.

137
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,305
ADAM: Which we may enjoy
as long as we do not eat from

138
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,015
the Tree of Knowledge
of good and evil.

139
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,022
GIZMO: Why is eating that fruit
a problem?

140
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,899
ADAM: It is what God told me.

141
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,151
EVE: He only wants
what is best for us.

142
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:43,739
ADAM: So whatever He asks of us,
we do. Anything else would be —

143
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,032
JOY: Disobedient?

144
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,957
PROF: And Chris, remember,
-- do not go in the lab!

145
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,252
CHRIS: Yeah. Disobedient.
That's the word.

146
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,713
ADAM: Come! Let us show you
our favorite waterfall!

147
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,717
SATAN: Don't worry...

148
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,927
CHRIS: Huh!!?

149
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,721
SATAN: Your father will
forget all about it.

150
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,328
JOY: This has been 'the' most
amazing day!

151
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,414
I wish we could stay forever!

152
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,419
CHRIS: Joy, remember that Angel
we saw in Heaven? The bad one?

153
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,923
He's here, in Eden! And I think
he can shapeshift!

154
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,510
JOY: No way, Chris. He fell into
a fiery pit. Remember?

155
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,387
You've been seeing things.

156
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,808
CHRIS: That's what worries me...

157
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,283
SATAN: Be careful what
you choose...

158
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,785
EVE: What do you mean?

159
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,454
SATAN: Has God indeed said,

160
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,790
'You shall not eat of every tree
of the garden?'

161
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,335
EVE: We may eat the fruit of the
trees of the garden.

162
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,378
But of the fruit of the tree
which is in the midst

163
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,297
of the garden -- God has said,

164
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,425
'You shall not eat it, nor shall
you touch it, lest you die.'

165
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,178
SATAN: You surely will not die.

166
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,805
For God knows that in the day
you eat of it,

167
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,974
your eyes will be opened,

168
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,898
and you will be like God
knowing good and evil.

169
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:00,084
You see? You've touched the
fruit and you did not die.

170
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,853
ADAM: Eve... What is the matter?

171
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,862
EVE: I feel -- everything...

172
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,162
ADAM: God told us not to...

173
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,541
EVE: I know, Adam... I know.

174
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,063
GIZMO: Ngh! What was that?

175
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,482
CHRIS: Man, this gonna be
a bad storm.

176
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,861
GIZMO: We'd better find
Adam and Eve.

177
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,494
CHRIS: You! I knew it!

178
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,957
We're not afraid of you.

179
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,667
SATAN: Why should you be?

180
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,921
After all, I only wish to help
you reach your full potential.

181
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,592
Watch, and learn!

182
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,355
Follow me and you can have
everything you want.

183
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,359
You humans can be masters of
your own destiny!

184
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,948
CHRIS: No!! You
don't want us to be masters!

185
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,285
You want us to be slaves.
Your slaves!

186
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,044
SATAN: People.
They're so simple...

187
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,725
GOD: Adam. Where are you?

188
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,522
ADAM: I heard Your voice in the
garden, and I was afraid

189
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,316
because I was naked;
and I hid myself.

190
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,694
GOD: Who told you that
you were naked?

191
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,697
Have you eaten from the tree of
which I commanded you

192
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,699
that you should not eat?

193
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,285
ADAM: The woman whom
You gave to be with me,

194
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,704
she gave me of the tree,
and I ate.

195
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,873
GOD: What is this you have done?

196
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,709
EVE: The serpent deceived me,
and I ate.

197
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,256
GOD: Because you
have done this,

198
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,841
you are cursed more
than all cattle,

199
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
and more than every
beast of the field;

200
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,845
on your belly you shall go,

201
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,722
and you shall eat dust
all the days of your life!

202
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,686
GOD: And you and the woman
will be enemies ...

203
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,688
and all her descendants.

204
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,358
And one will follow...
who shall bruise your head.

205
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,736
And you shall bruise His heel.

206
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,790
CHRIS: ADAM, EVE wait for us!!

207
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,920
LION! KITTY?!

208
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,591
GIZMO: My scanners indicate he
is not a kitty anymore.

214

GOD: I will greatly multiply
your sorrow

215
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,359
and in pain you shall bring
forth children;

216
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,862
Your desire shall be
for your husband,

217
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,281
and he shall rule over you.

218
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,575
Cursed is the ground
for your sake;

219
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,994
In the sweat of your
face you shall eat bread

220
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,623
till you return to the ground.
For out of it you were taken;

221
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:12,419
For dust you are,
And to dust you shall return.

222

I have for you,

00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,326
says the Lord,

229
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,496
they are plans for good,
and not for evil,

230
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,499
to give you a future
and a hope.

gonna do about this?

00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,863
GIZMO: Oh no! Professor Quantum
is home.

00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,950
Christopher?! My word!

238
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,868
What happened here?!

239
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,538
CHRIS: No excuse, Dad.

240
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,707
I came into the lab even though
you told me not to

241
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,584
--- and I saw the jetpack and
uh...

242
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,462
Son...
you're human.

243
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,675
And sometimes we humans don't
follow the rules...

244
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,845
even when we know it's wrong.

245
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,640
CHRIS: Dad, I'm sorry.
Do you still love me?

246
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,727
PROF: I'll always love you.

247
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,064
However, when you
knowingly disobey,

248
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,941
there are consequences.

249
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,111
I think for the next month,
there's no going to the mall

250
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,572
with your friends or
the skateboard park.

251
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,116
You'll also have to clean up
this lab. Buy another lamp.

252
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,493
Fix the stool. Wash the
windows...

253
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,828
GIZMO: Don't worry, Chris.

254
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,580
I can handle all that
for you in a jiffy.

255
